Tweakey is an Android app that acts as an advanced input device to PC and Mac computers.
It's built from the ground up around customisability, allowing you to tweak the app to best fit your personal use cases.

Tweakey can be used in place of a regular mouse and keyboard, or in accompaniment to them as a specialised shortcut keyboard.
It's great for controlling music playback from around the room, giving presentations, connecting your laptop to a TV, and being more efficient with productivity applications.

What makes Tweakey special is that input layouts can be created and customised to perfectly fit how you want to use the app.
It's easy to get rid of keys you never use, add useful shortcuts or even make layouts change dynamically depending on the task at hand.

Tweakey is currently in closed alpha testing, but will be available for download soon.
