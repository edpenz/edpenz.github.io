3D display technologies improve perception and interaction with 3D scenes, and hence can make applications more effective and efficient.
This is achieved by simulating depth cues used by the human visual system for 3D perception.
The type of employed depth cue and the characteristics of a 3D display technology affect its usability for different applications.
In this paper we review, analyze and categorize 3D display technologies and applications, with the goal of assisting application developers in selecting and exploiting the most suitable technology.

Our first contribution is a taxonomy of depth cues that incorporates their strengths and limitations.
These factors have not been considered in previous contributions, but they are important considerations when selecting depth cues for an application.
The second contribution is a taxonomy of display technologies that highlights their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their requirements.
We also provide examples of suitable applications for each technology.
This information helps system developers to select an appropriate display technology for their applications.
