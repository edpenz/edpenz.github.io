SCNC (squash club night client) is a utility program I wrote to help streamline weekly club nights for the Auckland University Squash Club.

It's currently being used at all AUSC club nights, and is also being considered for use at [Royal Oak Racquets Club](http://www.royaloakracquets.co.nz/).
Sources can be found on the [project's GitHub page](https://github.com/edpenz/scnc).

Members attending a club night sign in to the program, after which club execs can use it to automatically schedule matches between them.
Players are able to tweak their game preferences, letting them control the difficulty of their games, or play with specific people.
More competitive players can enter their match results and track their level on an integrated club ladder.
The ladder is also used to determine divisions and seedings for club tournaments.

Some extra functionality is available for execs, including synchronising with an online membership list, tracking member payments and reporting club statistics.
