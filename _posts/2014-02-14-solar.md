Solar is a simple Pebble watch face designed to look nice, be quick to read, and give a natural sense of the time of day.
The combination of a digital reading and 24-hour daylight dial gives the user both a precise and general indication of the current time.

The watch face is currently [available for download from Pebble store](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/52f9da3f260ca5d3ab000135).

Development of Solar has been superseded by [Routine](./routine), which displays additional information on top of what Solar is capable of.
