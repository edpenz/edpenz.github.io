Routine is a Pebble watch face designed around exposing and more intuitively presenting your daily routine and agenda.
It combines different representations of time to better convey their relation and help with organisation.

Routine is available as a Pebble app and companion Android app.
[The latest version of both](https://github.com/edpenz/routine/releases/latest) can be downloaded from the [project's github page](https://github.com/edpenz/routine).
The companion app is needed to sync calendar data to the watch face, but can also be used to change calendar priorities and create daily routines.

Like the similar [Solar watch face](./solar), it is visually structured around a circular 24-hour analogue dial representing the current day, starting with midnight at the bottom and progressing though morning on the left, midday on top and afternoon on the right.
The central dial indicates the current time in both digital and analogue fashion.
Surrounding this is shading indicating the duration of dawn, daylight, dusk and night.
Lastly, the day's agenda is drawn as blocks showing event start time, duration and importance.
