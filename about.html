<h1>Edward Peek</h1>
<h2>Software developer with an interest in graphics, UX and design</h2>

<p>
I've made this website as a place for me to collect and showcase some of the things I've worked on recently.
It's a nicer home for them all than the myriad of app stores, source repos and conference proceedings they would otherwise be scattered across.
</p>
<p>
Scripting computer games and creating them from scratch is what first got me into programming around 15 years ago.
Its influence is still apparent from my interest towards graphics, performance and interaction design.
</p>
<p>
In my free time I still love to game, and also enjoy toying with anything new and techy.
I take breaks from this geeky side by listening to music, reading and having a hit with friends at the local squash club.
